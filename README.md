# You run this code at your own risk.
1. This program will most likely lock your hard disk at full write speed and keep it there in order to make a massive file called      data.txt
2.  The only option to close this program is by force.
3. Your CPU: safety depends.
4. Your RAM: safety depends.
5. Your Storage space: finished (that is, FULL) unless you are careful.
